# Machine learning principles

The purpose of this repository is my self practice of machine learning principles, such as over and under-fitting. Exercise from the Book "Data Science from Scratch"

I am a student that is learning, let me know if you find any errors,the code is inspired from examples and exercises found in books.

## What I've learned?


* Machine learning is more than just training super complex models, is mainly about getting to understand your data set and    how can we use this data to solve "real life" problems.


* Even though machine learning is not only about models, models are essential to understand its purpose. Models tries to highlight mathematical or probabilistic relationships between different variables

* Machine Learning is about creating and using models that learned from data


* Overfitting is about creating a model that performs really well on the data used to train, however it can't generalize to new data

* Underfitting is about a model that doesn't perform well even on the training data

## The code

* To make sure that our model isn't too complex, we need to use different data to train the model and to test it.
Therefore we will start by splitting the dataset, two-thirds will be used to train, the remaining third to measure the model performance
