# Machine learning principles

The purpose of this repository is to practice the use of machine learning principles, such as over and under-fitting. Exercise from the Book "Data Science from Scratch"

## What I've learned?

* Machine learning is more than just training super complex models, is mainly about getting to understand your data set and    how can we use this data to solve "real life" problems.


* Even though machine learning is not only about models, models are essential to understand its purpose. Models tries to highlight mathematical or probabilistic relationships between different variables

## The code


## Resources that I used to learn about this fun topic:
* Book: Data Science from Scratch, Joel Grus
